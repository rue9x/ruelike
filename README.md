A Pico-8 "Physics-Based" Rogue-Like Game


Mostly dead now. But, was a fun attempt at doing procedural generation in pico-8. 

As a post-mortem, I think I was having a hard time here because I was going off LazyDev's tutorial, where he used maptiles as the basis of his generation, where as I insisted on using arrays for my generation. My method would have given me a lot more control over how things worked and would have allowed me to change rooms on the fly, save room states, save previous rooms, and do way more things than LazyDev's version provides. However, I ultimately don't have enough time to devote a project that is more supposed to be a learning experience.

I'll leave it up, of course, because code is valuable for everyone.
